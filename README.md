# Pet-Adoption-Truffle-Project
Alice's Pet Shop is interested in using Ethereum as an efficient way to handle their pet adoptions. The store has space for 16 pets at a given time, and they already have a database of pets. As an initial proof of concept, Alice wants to see a dapp which associates an Ethereum address with a pet to be adopted.
I have deployed it to Rinkeby testnetwork. To run this dapp you should have metamask account and some test ethers in your account.
